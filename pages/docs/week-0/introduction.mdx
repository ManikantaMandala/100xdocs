# Foundation Class

> Week 0 Warmup Lecture

## What We're Learning

In this introductory week, we will dive into the foundational elements that form the basis of web development. The key topics we'll be covering include:

1. **VSCode:** The integrated development environment (IDE) that we'll use for our coding tasks.
2. **HTML:** The language for structuring the content of our web pages.
3. **CSS:** The style sheet language for enhancing the visual presentation of our web pages.
4. **JS (JavaScript):** A powerful scripting language for adding interactivity to our web applications.
5. **DOM (Document Object Model):** Understanding how to manipulate the structure and content of our web pages dynamically.
6. **Assignments:** Practical exercises to reinforce our learning.

## What We'll Learn Practically

We'll explore both "Small Boi Stuff" and "Big Boi Stuff," covering essentials like HTML tags, CSS styling, and JavaScript basics. Here's a glimpse:

### Small Boi Stuff

1. Tags
2. Attributes
3. Flexbox
4. Inline styles (background color, fonts, etc.)
5. Connecting JS to HTML
6. Chrome Dev Tools

### Big Boi Stuff `translates to hard stuff`

1. External styles, classes, and IDs
2. JS Basics - Data types, loops, functions (selectors, DOM)

## What We're Building

Our practical application project involves creating an online investment platform named ZERODHA. We'll progress through different stages:

1. **Stage 1 (HTML Only):**

   - Structuring the content with HTML.
   - Initial layout of the ZERODHA platform.

2. **Stage 2 (HTML + CSS):**

   - Adding styles to enhance the visual appeal.

3. **Stage 3 (JS):**
   - Implementing functionality, such as creating a portfolio returns calculator.

## Before We Start

Before delving into coding, we'll address fundamental questions:

- What are browsers, and how do they render websites?
- The roles of HTML, CSS, and JS in web development.
- Industry relevance of HTML, CSS, and JS.

## IDE (Integrated Development Environment)

We'll be using:

- Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
- Vim
- WebStorm

## HTML Essentials

HTML defines the structure of our websites. Key jargon we need to know:

1. Tags
2. Attributes

### HTML Tags

- `<html>`
- `<head>`
- `<title>`
- `<body>`
- `<div>` / `<span>`
- `<h1>` to `<h6>`
- `<p>`
- `<img>`
- `<a>`
- `<input>`
- `<button>`
- `<b>` / `<i>`
- `<center>`

### Attributes

- `<img src="a.png">`
- `<a href="google.com">`
- `<button onclick="...">`
- `<input id="username">`

## CSS Basics

CSS allows us to add styles to our website, including colors, font sizes, and background colors. We'll explore common styling attributes and positioning techniques.

### Common Styling Attributes

- `color`
- `background`
- `border-radius`
- `border`
- `padding` / `margin`
- `box-shadow`

### How to Position Elements

We'll cover positioning with examples from our ZERODHA project.

- Understanding the box model.
- Working with divs and spans.
- Introduction to the float property.
- Using `display: flex` to create flexible layouts.
